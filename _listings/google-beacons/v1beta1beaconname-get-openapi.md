  title: Google Proximity Beacon API Get Beacon
  description: |-
    Returns detailed information about the specified beacon.

    Authenticate using an [OAuth access token](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2)
    from a signed-in user with **viewer**, **Is owner** or **Can edit**
    permissions in the Google Developers Console project.

    Requests may supply an Eddystone-EID beacon name in the form:
    `beacons/4!beaconId` where the `beaconId` is the base16 ephemeral ID
    broadcast by the beacon. The returned `Beacon` object will contain the
    beacon's stable Eddystone-UID. Clients not authorized to resolve the
    beacon's ephemeral Eddystone-EID broadcast will receive an error.

      description: |-
        Gets the Proximity Beacon API's current public key and associated
        parameters used to initiate the Diffie-Hellman key exchange required to
        register a beacon that broadcasts the Eddystone-EID format. This key
        changes periodically; clients may cache it and re-use the same public key
        to provision and register multiple beacons. However, clients should be
        prepared to refresh this key when they encounter an error registering an
        Eddystone-EID beacon.
